# Playwright Image Classification Matchers

This library extends the capabilities of Playwright, a powerful UI automation tool, by introducing image classification matchers. It allows you to perform image classification within your end-to-end (E2E) testing using Playwright and TypeScript. With this library, you can incorporate machine learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks, for image recognition and classification directly in your E2E tests.

## Keywords
- Playwright
- Expect
- Assertions
- TypeScript
- E2E Testing
- Classification
- Prediction
- Matchers
- Machine Learning
- Convolutional Neural Networks

## Usage Example

Here's an example of how to use the library in your Playwright E2E test:

```javascript
test('Verify Image Classification', async ({ page }) => {
    await page.goto("/");
    await expect(page.getByTestId("image-five")).toImageClassification("five");
});
```

In the above example, we navigate to a web page and use the `toImageClassification` matcher to classify an image with the label "five."

## Configuration

To use the library, you need to configure metadata for the image classification models. Here's an example configuration:

```json
metadata: {
    models: [{
        image: {
            name: "binary",
            file: "./cnn/model_output/binary/model.json",
            labels: [
                "nofive",
                "five"
            ],
            dimensions: {
                width: 28,
                height: 28
            }
        }
    }, {
        image: {
            name: "category",
            file: "./cnn/model_output/category/model.json",
            labels: [
                "four",
                "nine",
                "two"
            ],
            dimensions: {
                width: 28,
                height: 28
            }
        }
    }]
}
```

In this configuration, you specify models for different image classification tasks, including the model files, labels, and dimensions.
